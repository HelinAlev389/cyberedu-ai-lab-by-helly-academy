GPT Response:
**Incident Analysis:**

1. **Type of Incident:** Brute-force Attack
2. **Risk Level:** Medium
3. **Explanation:** The log indicates multiple failed login attempts (12 attempts) by the user "admin" from the IP address "203.0.113.45" on "Server-01." This pattern suggests a brute-force attack, where an attacker is trying multiple password combinations to gain unauthorized access to the system.
4. **Recommendation:** 
   - Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
   - Enforce strong password policies and encourage users to use multi-factor authentication.
