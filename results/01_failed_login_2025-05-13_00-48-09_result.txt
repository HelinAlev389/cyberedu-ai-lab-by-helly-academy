GPT Response:
Based on the log provided:

1. Type of Incident: Brute-force attack
2. Risk Level: Medium
3. Explanation: An attacker is attempting to log in to the system by repeatedly trying different combinations of login credentials (username and password). In this case, the "admin" account has experienced 12 failed login attempts from the IP address 203.0.113.45, indicating a brute-force attack.
4. Prevention/Response Recommendation: 
   - Preventive Measure: Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to deter brute-force attacks. Additionally, consider adopting strong password policies and use multi-factor authentication to increase security.
   - Response: Monitor the failed login attempts closely, investigate the source IP address for potential blocking, and alert system administrators to take further action to secure the system.
