GPT Response:
**Incident Analysis:**

1. **Type of Incident:** Brute-force Attack
2. **Risk Level:** Medium
3. **Explanation:** The log indicates a "failed_login" event where the user "admin" attempted to log in from the IP address "203.0.113.45" with 12 login attempts. This is indicative of a brute-force attack, where an attacker repeatedly tries different passwords or passphrases to gain unauthorized access to the system.
   
4. **Recommendation:** To prevent brute-force attacks, it is essential to implement strong password policies, enable account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed attempts, use multi-factor authentication, and consider IP blacklisting for repeated offenders. Additionally, monitoring login attempts and setting up intrusion detection systems can help in early detection and response to such incidents.
