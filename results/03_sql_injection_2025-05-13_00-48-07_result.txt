### Incident Analysis:
1. **Type of Incident:** SQL Injection
2. **Risk Level:** High
3. **Explanation:**
   - The log indicates an HTTP request to the URL "/login" with a payload "' OR '1'='1."
   - The payload suggests an attempt to exploit the web application by injecting SQL code to manipulate the database query, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data.

4. **Prevention/Response Recommendation:**
   - Employ input validation techniques to sanitize user inputs and prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - Implement parameterized queries or use Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks to mitigate SQL injection risks.
   - Regularly patch and update the web application and database systems to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

By understanding and implementing these preventive measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks on your systems.
