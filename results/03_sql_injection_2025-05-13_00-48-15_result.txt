GPT Response:
Based on the provided log, this appears to be a SQL injection attack, which is a type of injection attack often used to attack data-driven applications by inserting malicious SQL code into an entry field for execution. 

Assessment of Risk Level:
- Risk Level: High
- SQL injection attacks can potentially lead to unauthorized access to databases, data leaks, data manipulation, and even complete server compromise.

Explanation:
In this incident, an attacker is attempting a SQL injection attack by inserting the payload "' OR '1'='1" into the "/login" URL. This payload is a common SQL injection attempt to bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive information from the database. The attacker is trying to trick the application into returning information by making the query always evaluate to true ('1'='1').

Prevention or Response Recommendation:
1. Input Sanitization: Implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
2. Use of Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Deploy WAF to analyze incoming traffic to the web application and block malicious SQL injection attempts.
3. Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities like SQL injection before they are exploited. 

It is crucial to address and mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities promptly to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and protect the integrity of the application and its users.
