GPT Response:
Based on the information provided in the log, this incident can be identified as a SQL injection attempt. Here are the details:

1. Type of Incident: SQL Injection
2. Risk Level: High
3. Explanation:
   - A SQL injection occurs when an attacker tries to manipulate the input fields of a web application to execute unauthorized SQL commands.
   - In this log, the payload "' OR '1'='1" is a classic example of a SQL injection attempt, where the attacker is trying to bypass authentication by making the query return true regardless of the input.
   - If successful, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even take control of the entire database.

4. Prevention/Response Recommendation:
   - Implement input validation and parameterized queries in the web application to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - Regularly update and patch the web application to fix any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
   - Educate developers and users about the risks of SQL injection and the importance of secure coding practices.
   - Monitor web application logs for any unusual or malicious activities and respond promptly to any detected incidents.
