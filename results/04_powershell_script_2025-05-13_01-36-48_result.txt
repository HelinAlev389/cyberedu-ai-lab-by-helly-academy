2. **Risk Level:** High

3. **Explanation:** The log shows that a user named "student02" executed a Powershell command which translates to "hello world" encoded in Base64. Powershell is a powerful scripting language in Windows that can be used by cyber attackers to execute malicious commands, download malware, or perform other unauthorized actions on a system.

4. **Prevention/Response Recommendation:** 
   - Ensure that users have the necessary permissions to execute Powershell commands only for legitimate purposes.
   - Monitor and analyze Powershell activity on systems to detect any suspicious or unauthorized commands.
   - Implement application whitelisting to restrict the execution of unauthorized scripts or commands.
   - Regularly update and patch systems to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited through Powershell attacks.
