GPT Response:
**Incident Analysis:**

1. **Type of Incident:** Privilege Escalation

2. **Risk Level:** High

3. **Explanation:** 
   - Privilege escalation is when an attacker gains higher-level access or permissions than they are supposed to have. In this case, the user "student03" has been added to the Administrators group on the Domain Controller-01. This means that student03 now has elevated privileges that can potentially be misused to access sensitive information, make unauthorized changes, or disrupt the system.

4. **Prevention/Response Recommendation:**
   - To prevent privilege escalation incidents, it is crucial to implement the principle of least privilege. This means users should only have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. Regularly review and audit user permissions to ensure they are appropriate. Additionally, enable logging and monitoring of privileged actions to detect and respond to any unauthorized changes promptly.
