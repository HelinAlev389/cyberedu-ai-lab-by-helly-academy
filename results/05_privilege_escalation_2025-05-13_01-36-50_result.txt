**Incident Analysis:**

1. **Type of Incident:** Privilege Escalation
2. **Risk Level:** High
3. **Explanation:** In this incident, a user named "student03" has successfully elevated their privileges by being added to the Administrators group on "DomainController-01." Privilege escalation is a serious security issue where a user gains more access rights than intended, enabling them to perform unauthorized actions within the system.
4. **Prevention/Response Recommendation:** To prevent privilege escalation incidents, it is essential to enforce the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and restrict user permissions, implement multi-factor authentication, monitor user activity, and conduct security audits to identify and resolve vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation attacks. In response to this specific incident, the user "student03" should be immediately removed from the Administrators group, and a thorough investigation should be conducted to determine how the unauthorized action occurred and prevent future similar incidents.
