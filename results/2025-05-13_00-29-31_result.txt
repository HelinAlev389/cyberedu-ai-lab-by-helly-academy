**Incident Analysis:**

1. **Type of Incident:** This log indicates a failed login attempt.

2. **Risk Level:** Medium
   - While a single failed login attempt may not pose an immediate high risk, it could indicate potential unauthorized access attempts or credential guessing.

3. **Explanation:** In simple terms, someone (in this case, "student01") tried to log in to a system ("Lab-PC-03") but failed to enter the correct credentials. This could be due to the user mistyping their password or someone trying to gain unauthorized access to the system by guessing passwords repeatedly.

4. **Prevention/Response Recommendation:**
   - **Prevention:** To prevent such incidents, it is important to educate users about strong password practices, enable multi-factor authentication, limit login attempts, and monitor failed login attempts for suspicious patterns.
   - **Response:** In response to this incident, the security team should investigate further to determine if this is an isolated event or part of a larger attack. They should also consider implementing additional security measures such as IP blacklisting or implementing tools that detect and block brute force attacks.

By understanding and addressing such incidents, organizations can enhance their cybersecurity posture and protect their systems and data from potential threats.
