GPT Response:
### Incident Analysis:
1. **Type of Incident:** Privilege Escalation
2. **Risk Level:** High
3. **Explanation:**
   - Privilege escalation is a type of cyber incident where an attacker gains unauthorized access to higher levels of permissions or privileges than intended. In this case, the user "student03" has been added to the "Administrators" group on the "DomainController-01."
   
4. **Prevention/Response Recommendation:** 
   - **Prevention:** Implement the principle of least privilege, where users are granted only the minimum level of access required to perform their job functions. Regularly review and audit user permissions to ensure they are appropriate. Enforce strong authentication methods and monitor user activities for any suspicious behavior.
   - **Response:** Immediately revoke the unauthorized privileges granted to "student03," investigate the incident to determine the root cause, and strengthen access control measures to prevent such privilege escalation in the future.
