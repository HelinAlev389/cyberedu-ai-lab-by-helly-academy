### Incident Analysis:
1. **Type of Incident:** Brute-force attack (multiple failed login attempts).
  
2. **Risk Level:** Medium
  
3. **Explanation:**
   Someone (potentially an unauthorized user) is repeatedly trying to log in to the system using the username "student01" from the IP address "192.168.1.56" located at "Lab-PC-03". This pattern of failed login attempts indicates a brute-force attack where an attacker is systematically trying different password combinations to gain unauthorized access.

4. **Prevention/Response Recommendation:**
   - **Prevention:** 
     - Enforce strong password policies to mitigate brute-force attacks.
     - Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts.
     - Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for additional security.
   - **Response:**
     - Monitor the IP address and block it if the behavior continues.
     - Investigate further to determine the source and motive of the attack.
     - Inform the user "student01" to be cautious and possibly reset their password.
