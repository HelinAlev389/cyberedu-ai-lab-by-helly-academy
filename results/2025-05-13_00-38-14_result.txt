GPT Response:
**Incident Analysis:**

1. **Type of Incident:** Brute-force attack
2. **Risk Level:** Medium
3. **Explanation:** The log indicates a "failed_login" event with no specific user involved, originating from IP address "192.168.1.56" located in "Lab-PC-03." This suggests a potential brute-force attack where an attacker is trying to gain unauthorized access to the system by repeatedly trying different username and password combinations.
4. **Recommendation:** 
   - Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
   - Enforce strong password policies and consider implementing multi-factor authentication to enhance security.

By taking these preventive measures, the risk of successful unauthorized access through brute-force attacks can be mitigated.
