**Incident Analysis:**

1. **Type of Incident:** Brute-force attack
2. **Risk Level:** Medium
3. **Explanation:** The log entry indicates a failed login attempt from the user "ххахха" at IP address "192.168.1.56" in location "Lab-PC-03." This likely suggests that someone attempted to gain unauthorized access to the system by guessing login credentials repeatedly, which is known as a brute-force attack. Attackers use automated tools to try different combinations of usernames and passwords until they find the correct one to access the system.
   
4. **Prevention/Response Recommendation:** To prevent brute-force attacks, it's essential to implement strong password policies, enable account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts, and use multi-factor authentication. Additionally, monitoring for unusual login patterns and IP addresses can help detect and respond to such attacks promptly. Regular security awareness training for users on creating strong passwords and recognizing phishing emails can also enhance the overall security posture.
