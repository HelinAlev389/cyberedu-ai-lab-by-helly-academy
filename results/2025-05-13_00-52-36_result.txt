GPT Response:
Based on the log provided:

1. Type of Incident: Failed Login
2. Risk Level: Low
3. Explanation: The log indicates that a user named "student01" attempted to log in but failed. This could be due to mistyping the password, forgetting the password, or potentially an unauthorized login attempt by someone else. While a single failed login attempt may not indicate a serious security threat, multiple failed login attempts could be a sign of a brute-force attack where an attacker tries different password combinations to gain unauthorized access.
4. Prevention/Response Recommendation: To prevent potential unauthorized access or brute-force attacks, it is recommended to implement strong password policies, enable multi-factor authentication, and monitor login attempts for any suspicious patterns. Additionally, educating users on the importance of secure password practices can help mitigate such incidents.
