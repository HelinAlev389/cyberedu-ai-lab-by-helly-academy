GPT Response:
Based on the log provided, let's analyze it according to the given tasks:

1. Incident Type: This log indicates a "failed login" event, which suggests that someone with the username "student01" attempted to log in but was unsuccessful. This could potentially be indicative of a brute-force attack, where an attacker tries multiple username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access.

2. Risk Level: The risk level for this incident would be assessed as Medium. While a single failed login attempt may not pose an immediate severe threat, it could indicate an ongoing or potential security breach if multiple such attempts are made.

3. Explanation: In simple terms, this log shows that someone using the username "student01" tried to log into a system from the IP address "192.168.1.56" located in "Lab-PC-03." The fact that the login attempt failed means that the system's security measures likely prevented unauthorized access.

4. Prevention/Response Recommendation: To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access in the future, it is recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts, including "student01." MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional proof of identity beyond just a username and password, such as a code sent to their mobile device. Additionally, monitoring and logging failed login attempts can help in detecting and responding to potential security incidents promptly.
