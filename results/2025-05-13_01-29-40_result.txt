GPT Response:
### Incident Analysis:

1. **Type of Incident**: Brute-force Attack
2. **Risk Level**: Medium
3. **Explanation**: The log indicates a "failed_login" event, suggesting that someone, possibly an unauthorized individual, attempted to log in to the system using the username "student01" from the IP address "192.168.1.56" at the location "Lab-PC-03." A brute-force attack is a type of cyberattack where an attacker tries multiple username and password combinations in rapid succession to gain unauthorized access to a system. In this case, the attacker failed to authenticate successfully but may continue trying with different credentials.
4. **Prevention/Response Recommendation**: 
   - Implement account lockout policies to prevent multiple failed login attempts.
   - Enforce strong password policies and encourage the use of multi-factor authentication.
   - Monitor login attempts closely for any further suspicious activity and consider blocking the source IP address if repeated failed logins occur.
