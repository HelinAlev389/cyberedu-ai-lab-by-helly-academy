### Incident Analysis:
1. **Type of Incident:** Brute-force attack (Failed Login Attempt).
   
2. **Risk Level:** Medium.

3. **Explanation:** Someone using the username "student01" attempted to log in from the IP address "192.168.1.56" multiple times but failed to authenticate each time. This indicates a brute-force attack, where an unauthorized user is trying different password combinations to gain access to the system.

4. **Prevention/Response Recommendation:** 
   - Implement account lockout policies to prevent multiple login attempts after a certain number of failures.
   - Enforce strong password policies for all users to make it harder for attackers to guess passwords.
   - Monitor and analyze login attempts for unusual patterns or multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.

Stay vigilant and ensure your systems are protected against brute-force attacks to safeguard sensitive information.
